# Song Lyric Term Matching

This repo contains the code that I used to create a Shiny app that searches for matching terms between song lyrics.

The app can be found [here](https://michaelpawlus.shinyapps.io/song_lyric_term_matching/)

#### Acknowledgements

It is important to note that the [geniusR package](https://github.com/JosiahParry/geniusR) is doing all the heavy lifting here. So, big thanks to Josiah for making this really easy.

In addition, the term matching function is borrowed almost verbatim from the excellent [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html)
